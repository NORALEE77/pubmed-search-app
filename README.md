# 🔎 PubMed Medical Search Engine

A clean and interactive medical search engine built with **Streamlit**, enabling semantic search over a local **PubMed** corpus using **TF-IDF** vectorization and **cosine similarity**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a lightweight information retrieval system for biomedical literature.  
Users can submit free-text medical queries in English and retrieve the most relevant PubMed articles, ranked by semantic similarity.

The application processes article **titles and abstracts**, builds a TF-IDF index, and returns the **Top-K** most relevant documents with similarity scores and direct links to PubMed.
